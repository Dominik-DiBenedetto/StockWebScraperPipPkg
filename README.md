# StockWebScraperPipPkg
Open source stock webscraper, downloadable through PIP (python's package manager)

The stock-webscraper makes getting stock prices easier then ever to get started run:
pip install stock-webscraper

create a new file and import stock-webscraper
now to get the price of a stock simply make a variable call it whatever you want (prefirebly price) and set it equal to getPrice("APPL") 
replace "APPL" with the ticker symbol of the stock you want to get so it should look like 
price = getPrice("APPL") # Change APPL to ticker symbol of desired stock
